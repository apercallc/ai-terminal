  <!--
    Hardened Runtime (Developer ID) typically works with an empty entitlements file.
    Keep this minimal unless you *specifically* need an entitlement.

    If you plan to distribute via the Mac App Store (sandbox required), you will
    need a different entitlements set and should expect restrictions on spawning
    shells / accessing arbitrary filesystem paths.
