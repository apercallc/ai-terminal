        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of AI Terminal (the "App"), provided by
          Aperca LLC ("we", "us", "our"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to
          these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Bring Your Own AI Providers (BYO Keys)</h2>
        <p>
          AI Terminal is free to use, but AI features may require third-party AI services (for example,
          OpenAI or Anthropic) or a local model server (for example, LM Studio). You are responsible
          for creating accounts, obtaining API keys, paying any provider fees, and complying with the
          third-party provider terms.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Local Execution & Responsibility</h2>
        <p>
          AI Terminal can propose and execute shell commands on your device. You are solely
          responsible for reviewing commands, approving execution, and understanding the effects of
          running commands in your environment. Commands may modify files, install software, change
          system settings, or cause data loss.
        </p>

        <h2>4. No Warranties</h2>
        <p>
          THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
          IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, APERCA LLC WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
          INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA,
          USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE
          APP, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES RESULTING FROM COMMANDS EXECUTED ON YOUR
          DEVICE.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          The App may interact with third-party services you configure. We do not control and are not
          responsible for those services, their availability, or their security practices.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>
          You agree not to use the App for unlawful purposes. You are responsible for ensuring that
          your usage complies with applicable laws, regulations, and third-party provider policies.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update
          the effective date above.
        </p>
